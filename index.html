        </div>
          <br>
          <p>The Parks (Ilford) is a private residential estate. This means council do not pick up the bulk refusal items like Fridge, Furniture, Sofa and Beds.<b> It is illegal to dump the bulk rubbish</b> and it costs money to all of us as we arrange private contractors to pick them up. In financial year 2018 and 2019,<b> we paid in excess of £30,000 each year. </b> Now that the CCTV cameras are operational, we have started charging the residence who found to be dumping the bulk items.<br><br>

<b><h4>How to arrange Bulk Waste:</h4></b>
If possible, drive to the tip and take your items there in your car. Google "Redbridge Tip".<br>Redbridge council also allows residents to arrange the large item collection for free <a href=" https://www.redbridge.gov.uk/bins-waste-and-recycling/book-a-bulky-waste-or-large-item-collection/"> <b>Click Here</b> </a>. 
You can also arrange the pickup with Heart Foundation<a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/shop/donating-goods/book-furniture-collection-near-me"> <b>(Click Here)</b> </a> or find a Bulk Waste Company online.


Please follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>Book the collection with the council/Heart Foundation/Private. </li>
  <li> A night before the collection date, place the item outside the house or near bin area (if live in flats)</li>
  <li> Make sure proper notices are affixed on the bulk waste items. Affix the collection confirmation letter/details as well as your address so everyone is aware that it will be collected by council.</li>
</ol>
Please make sure you don’t put the items outside before the collection date and always post the confirmation document/property address so everyone is aware of it.
</p>
    <p>Since the CCTV cameras are now activated, 
    <ol>
        <li>We will start issuing the fine (minimum £100), once we identify the people throwing stuff. This charge will be added to the service charge.
    Please read the <a href="./docs/BulkRubbishProcess.pdf"> <b>process document </b></a>. Home owners, please make sure your renters are aware of it.</li>
    <li>We will send the CCTV recording and evidence/person details to the council who will also take actions as per the law, this include crimimal prosecution as well as fine/penalty by the council</li>
    </ol>

      <p>There is many types of expenses, some apply to flats, some to houses. In summary we have 3 heads.
      <ol>
        <li><b>Estate Level Charges</b>: This is paid by everyone. There are 212 properties.</li>
        <li><b>Block Level Charges</b>: This is paid by flat owners, including the block G but not inclduing social housing. There are 103 flats, however breakup is not even, please see this <a href="./docs/Apportionments.pdf"> <b>Document</b></a></li>
        <li><b>Block G Charges</b>: This is paid by Block G owners only. There are 28 properties.</li>
      </ol>
      
      </p>
      <p>Management Agent fee is not equally divided. Houses and Social Housing pays £60 while rest of the charges paid by 101 flats using the block level charges calcultion.<br>
      Depending upon your property, the specific sections in the budget will apply to you. All numbers are rounded up to a £.
        </p>
        You can also download this Excel sheet to see the calculation yourself and use it for next year budgets.<a href="./docs/BudgetPortionCalculator.xlsx"> <b>Download worksheet</b></a>

      <div class="card-body">
      <p>The details explanation of service charges are defined in the FAQ of Budget Document. However, The service charges have been rising for past 3-4 years. We have been paying every year budget amount in July and then at the fiancial year end, we pay some more (in december when the year is closed) due to expenditure overshooting the budget. The main reasons for it was JPW, our previous Management company, which increased their Management Fee from 26k to 52k, as well as Bulk Rubbish which costed us £30k every year for past 3 years. You can read more in year end financial document under Documents Section</p>
      <p> The new Directors and the Management company are trying to decrease the amount we are paying all together by decreasing the cost, get more services like CCTV without increasing the budget amount and get the repair/services down as cheaply as possible. This may produce slight underpar services, but its a fine line we are trying to tread</p>
      <p>Though Budget 2021 doesn't show the saving on the face of it, however, without massive increase in the service charges, we are getting CCTV and rubbish collection done. We are aiming to stop asking for more money at the year end and try to live within the budget, however we are still waiting for end of financial year July 2021 accounts done by JPW.</p>
      <p> We are hoping to see the positive results when year 2021 ends in June 2022 and next budget is annouced in July 2022</p>
      <p><b>Note: Financial Year July-2020 - June 2021 is not closed yet by JPW. When they do, we are expecting the additional payment would be needed due to budget overshoot (we know they have been doing it for past 3 years). We will try to go through the invoices and documents when available to us and challenge it where applicable, however, this additional amount is nothing to do with Red Rock or the new Directors.</b>
